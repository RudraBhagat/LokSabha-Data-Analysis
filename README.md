📊 Lok Sabha 2024 Election Data – From Raw CSV to Actionable Insights 🚀

Elections are more than just numbers — they reveal stories of people, regions, and shifting trends.
To explore this, I took the official 2024 Lok Sabha election results and turned them into a visual story powered by data.

🛠 Tech Stack:
🐍 Python | 📦 Pandas, NumPy | 🎨 Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 What I Did:

Imported and cleaned raw election data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating calculated metrics like margin of victory.

Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns hidden within thousands of rows of constituency-level results.

Built visualizations to make data easy to interpret — from party-wise seat distribution to candidate-level performance comparisons.

💡 Key Insights Discovered:

The largest and smallest winning margins across constituencies 🏆📉

Party-wise performance trends, highlighting strongholds and swing areas

Direct comparisons between key leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah

Regional voting patterns that reveal the political landscape 🌏

📈 Every chart in this carousel is a step in the journey — from messy CSV files to clear, compelling visual narratives.
